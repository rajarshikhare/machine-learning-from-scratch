# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the implementation of various machine learning algorithms from scratch. The goal is to provide a deeper understanding of the algorithms' workings by coding them without relying on high-level library functions. Each notebook includes a detailed explanation of the algorithm's theory, followed by a step-by-step Python implementation and an example application on real-world datasets.

## Implemented Algorithms

- **Adaline Model**: Adaptive Linear Neuron model for binary classification tasks.
- **Digit Recognizer**: Implementation of algorithms for recognizing handwritten digits.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Technique to identify unusual patterns that do not conform to expected behavior.
- **Fuzzy KNN**: Variant of K-Nearest Neighbors that uses fuzzy logic for classification.
- **Hebb Model**: Simple neural network based on Hebbian theory.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Unsupervised algorithm for clustering similar data points together.
- **Linear Regression**: Predictive modeling technique for estimating the relationships between variables.
- **Logistic Regression**: Classification algorithm for binary and multiclass classification tasks.
- **Neural Network**: Basic neural network implementation for pattern recognition.
- **Perceptron Model**: The simplest type of artificial neural network for binary classification.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed. If not, install it via Anaconda or pip.
3. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory.
4. Open a terminal and run `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab`.
5. Open any of the `.ipynb` notebook files to view the implementation and instructions.

## Upcoming Additions

- **SVM (Support Vector Machines)**: A powerful classification technique that works well on linearly separable data and non-linear data by using kernel tricks.
- **Spam Classifier**: An application of machine learning algorithms to classify emails/messages as spam or not spam.
- **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)**: A simple, lazy learning algorithm used for classification and regression.

Stay tuned for updates and additional implementations!
